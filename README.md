# Conffusion
Sometimes its confusing to have many config files or many operating system installations. Sometimes, after installing a new system, you
want to configure it the same as another system. Focused on linux this program wants to enable backing up config files
and bootstrapping new systems with them. 

# Todo
* review zipping and make recursive zipping to prepare for 3rd party scripts
* move 1 config file to etc, zip the config file with the data
* make bootstrapping possible and test in a Virtual Maschine
